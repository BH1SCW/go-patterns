A collection of design & application patterns for Go language.

## Creational Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Status |
|:-------:|:----------- |:------:|
| [Factory](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/creational/01_factory/)|Provides an interface for creating families of releated objects | ✔ |
| [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/creational/02_abstractfactory/) | Provides an interface for creating families of releated objects | ✔ |
| [Singleton](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/creational/03_singleton) | Restricts instantiation of a type to one object | ✔ |
| [Builder](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/creational/04_builder/) | Builds a complex object using simple objects | ✔ |
| [Prototype](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/creational/05_prototype) | Instantiates and maintains a group of objects instances of the same type | ✔ |


## Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Status |
|:-------:|:----------- |:------:|
| [Adapter](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/06_adapter) |  | ✔ |
| [Bridge](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/07_bridge) | Decouples an interface from its implementation so that the two can vary independently | ✔ |
| [Filter](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/08_filter) |  | ✔ |
| [Composite](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/09_composite) | Encapsulates and provides access to a number of different objects | ✔ |
| [Decorator](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/10_decorator) | Adds behavior to an object, statically or dynamically | ✔ |
| [Facade](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/11_facade) | Uses one type as an API to a number of others | ✔ |
| [Flyweight](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/12_flyweight) | Reuses existing instances of objects with similar/identical state to minimize resource usage | ✔ |
| [Proxy](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/structural/13_proxy) | Provides a surrogate for an object to control it's actions | ✔ |

## Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Status |
|:-------:|:----------- |:------:|
| [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/14_chain) | Avoids coupling a sender to receiver by giving more than object a chance to handle the request | ✔ |
| [Command](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/15_command) | Bundles a command and arguments to call later | ✔ |
| [Interpreter](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/16_interpreter) | interpreter | ✔ |
| [Mediator](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/17_mediator) | Connects objects and acts as a proxy | ✔ |
| [Memento](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/18_memento) | Generate an opaque token that can be used to go back to a previous state | ✔ |
| [Observer](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/19_observer) | Provide a callback for notification of events/changes to data | ✔ |
| [State](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/20_state) | Encapsulates varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state | ✔ |
| [Strategy](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/21_strategy) | Enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime | ✔ |
| [Template](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/22_template) | Defines a skeleton class which defers some methods to subclasses | ✔ |
| [Visitor](https://github.com/helight/go-patterns/tree/master/src/behavioral/23_visitor) | Separates an algorithm from an object on which it operates | ✔ |
